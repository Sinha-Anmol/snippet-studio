## Snippet Studio
# Project Overview

This project, titled "Snippet Studio", focuses on developing an advanced web application similar to CodePen. It utilizes the ReactJS library to craft user interfaces and the CodeMirror library to implement robust code editor functionality.

The primary objective is to build a responsive user interface with ReactJS, facilitating seamless navigation and efficient management of code snippets. CodeMirror will be integrated to provide a feature-rich code editor, including syntax highlighting and other advanced features.

Users will have the ability to create, edit, and share HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets, viewing real-time execution results of their code.

Overall, Snippet Studio aims to integrate ReactJS and CodeMirror to create a comprehensive, web-based front-end development environment.
